                  the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation 
                  (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
                   efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of 
                   ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational, 
                   technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998,
